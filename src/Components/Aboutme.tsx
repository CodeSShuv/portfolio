                    I'm Shuvam Gautam, a self-taught programmer and a BCA student currently in my 3rd semester. I specialize in web development with React, Node.js, and MongoDB, along with DSA in Java. I love solving problems, building intuitive websites, and constantly learning new tech. Currently exploring competitive coding as a hobby because who doesn't love a good challenge?
